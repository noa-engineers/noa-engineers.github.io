			<p>NOA staff consists of 6 registered professional electrical engineers (P.E.E.’s), including one registered professional mechanical engineer (P.M.E.)/fire protection engineer (F.P.E.) and 2 registered communication distribution designers, with over 200 years of cumulative experience, 7 electrical designers and draftsmen, and two administrative personnel.</p>
<p>The structure of NOA’s staff of 12 technical and 2 administrative personnel, who have worked together for numerous years (nearly half of the personnel have been with the firm for over 10 years) is very flexible wherein individuals can easily shift from project to project to meet our client’s schedules.  Unlike other firms which change staffing rapidly as a function of workload, NOA strives to maintain a consistent manageable number of personnel by rapid adjustment and management of expenses.  This allows us to be always staffed and ready to receive new projects.</p>
<p>Should the need arise, NOA’s staff is accustomed to working of fast track projects; our staff is ready to work longer hours if necessary, and we additionally supplement our full-time personnel with part-time designers and drafters to help meet any unexpected accelerated deadlines.  Also, because of our experience in working on large projects with short deadlines, our staff is easily adaptable to shifting from one project to another to meet necessary deadlines without sacrificing quality.</p>
<p>NOA technical staff utilizes computer aided design and drafting programs&#8211;Autocad and  Intergraph Microstation.  We are also familiar with a variety of exterior and interior and electrical calculation programs and utilize a number of in-house developed spreadsheets and data bases for calculations and cost estimating.  NOA’s PC’s utilize Windows 7 operating systems with Windows for CADD servers.  Our office hardware include numerous large format printers, plotters, and scanners for optimal production of design documents.</p>
<p>NOA’s library consists of a multitude of manufacturer’s catalogs, NEMA, EEI, IPCEA, ICEE, TIA/EIA, IES, UL, NFPA, State of Hawaii and local County codes and standards, Federal specifications, standards and guides, utility company standards, CCB quarterly updates, CAD files of standard details, etc., which are continually updated. NOA also subscribes to many technical periodicals, journals, magazines and newsletters to keep abreast of the latest technology.</p>
<p>In addition, NOA also maintains a large inventory of electrical test equipment for field investigation, troubleshooting and quick identification of existing electrical installation problems.  In addition to light meter, recording and clamp-on ammeters and volt-ohm meters, our office has underground pipe and cable locators, circuit tracers, megohmeter, ground resistance test meters, power harmonics and analyser, transient voltage analyzers, 50 MHZ scope meter, fiberoptic and UTP cable testers, infrared temperature sensor, magnetic field intensity meter, sound level meter, gas detection meter, etc.</p>
<p>NOA always strives to meet the client’s needs, including all deadlines and applicable codes and regulations.  Our goal of client satisfaction is reflected in the number of repeat business from many of our clients which include Owners / Developers / Government agencies, such as First Hawaiian Bank; Zippy’s, Inc.; Central Pacific Bank; Don Quijote; Hawaiian Electric Company; Polynesian Cultural Center, Naval Facilities Engineering Command PACDIV; Corps of Engineers Pacific Ocean Division; University of Hawaii; State of Hawaii Department of Accounting and General Services, Department of Education and Department of Transportation, University of Hawaii, Board of Water Supply; Department of Design and Construction, as well as other A-E firms.  NOA endeavors to be responsible during all phases of a project which include planning, design and construction and provides quick responses during construction to address requests for clarification or unforeseen field conditions to mitigate project delays.  In general, NOA’s cost estimates have been within 10 percent of awarded contract bids, much to our client’s satisfaction.  In order to control project cost, NOA compiles cost data of past projects and subscribes to Trade Service for electrical material unit cost updates and Means, BNI, etc., for labor manhours.</p>
<p>NOA quality control procedures typically involves review of work by the principal and additionally by another engineer not directly involved with production, specifications or drawings for the project of interest.  NOA has Redi-Check and other in-house checklists. NOA key engineers and designers are periodically enrolled in the Design Professional’s Insurance Company home-study course.  The principals and some staff members have attended Ready-Check Training and Value Engineering Workshop.</p>
